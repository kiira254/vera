   <h1 style="padding-left:425px"> Skin Problems</h1>
   <p style="padding-left:425px"> Skin is the largest body organ, so the effects of its disorders are as psychological as they are physical. By applying a cleanser that is too harsh for your skin or doesn't get your skin clean means any of those products won't penetrate your skin well and won't help effectively.

Sometimes the product that is fighting against each other or is not addressing what is causing their skin problem is a matter of grave concern.

We will discuss a few of the common skin problems to help you understand your skin and your choices so that you are in control of your skin's health.

According to Dr Macrene Alexiades-Armenakas, assistant clinical professor at Yale University School of Medicine, acne, eczema, seborrhea dermatitis, skin cancer, and psoriasis are the few common skin disorders.

Healthy skin is optimally hydrated to hold the appropriate amount of water accurately to stay supple and nourished.</p>

   <h1 float='right'> You Must Know About All Types of Acne Problems You!</h1>
   <p float='right'> The clogging of the hair follicles with dead skin cells, dirt and sebum that connects the skin's pores to the oil glands causes acne, also known as acne vulgaris. It appears most often on the face, neck, shoulders, chest and back. Whiteheads, blackheads or pimples are the most commonly known.

Hormones and heredity factors mostly result in acne. It peaks in the teenage years mainly, because growth hormone releases at a very high frequency during the adolescent stage.

   <h1 style="padding-left:425px"> So, what does your skin need to prevent acne?</h1>
   <p style="padding-left:425px" >
&#9826; If you are susceptible to breakouts or have oily skin, do remember washing your face as a morning and evening skincare routine.</br>
&#9826; Choose the best cleanser that is mild and without a lot of ingredients and fragrances that cleanses your pores effectively and removes dead and damaged skin cells, leaving you with a smoother, brighter and blemish-free skin. Instead of shelling your pockets on expensive cleansers, keeping it simple is probably the best.</br>
&#9826; Apply an acne-fighting agent by finding the most effective one for you and choosing a combination of benzoyl peroxide, retinoid, or adapalene gel recommended by the dermatologists.</br>

<p style="padding-left:425px"  >&#9826; Apply a light moisturizer and look for the one that's non comedogenic, i.e., not clogging your pores. During the winter months cold, dry air can leave skin feeling tight and dried out. Some people may need to switch to heavier moisturizers during winters.</br></p>
&#9826; Presence of dead cells on your face may make your skin look dull, flaky, or prematurely aged.Exfoliation can help in removing excess dead skin cells as they can clog your pores and lead to breakouts if they stay for too long.</br>

&#9826; Ensure your makeup routine is skin-friendly. Always wash your hands before applying makeup or skincare products. It is essential to remove your makeup before going to sleep or exercising.Make sure that you clean the makeup brushes and sponges weekly.</br>
&#9826; Focusing on certain lifestyle factors, like quality sleep, a healthy diet, and stress management, can make a difference to your skin, too. </br>
